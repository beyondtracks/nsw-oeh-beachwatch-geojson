# nsw-oeh-beachwatch-geojson

The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) [publishes a bunch of GeoRSS feeds of swimming suitability](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/beachwatch) as part of [Beachwatch](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/beachmapp/), this project aims to make that feed more developer friendly.

You can either build this application into your own pipeline or use the hosted URL at https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-oeh-beachwatch.geojson (no service availability guarantees!), [preview it at geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#data=data:text/x-url,https://www.beyondtracks.com/contrib/nsw-oeh-beachwatch.geojson).

# Where is it used?

This pipeline has been built for [www.beyondtracks.com](https://www.beyondtracks.com) to provide information about water quality of swimming spots along bushwalks.

# Features

 - **Data only** Where possible, the properties data void of any formatting.
 - **GeoJSON** GeoJSON is more web developer friendly than GeoRSS (XML)
 - **Drop unneeded or duplicate properties**
 - **Coordinate Precision** Practically beach markers won't be more than 10m in accuracy so limiting to 4 decimal places will suffice.
 - **Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header** The upstream feeds lack this header meaning web applications aren't able to use the feed directly. The sample crontab file allows you to reduce and host the Beachwatch data and serve it with your own HTTP server to add this header. This issue was reported to OEH on the 24th Nov 2015 with the reply that they will follow up with their digital strategy people and will advise once they have responded.

# Usage

Install the Node dependencies with:

    yarn install

Run the script with:

    ./bin/nsw-oeh-beachwatch-geojson nsw-oeh-beachwatch.geojson

This will download the upstream feeds, process them and save the resulting GeoJSON file at `nsw-oeh-beachwatch.geojson`.

# Warranty

The use of information in the Beachwatch feed can affect peoples health.
Errors or omissions may be present and/or the upstream supplied data
structure may change without any notice causing issues. Use at your own risk.
